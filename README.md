### Is there a diffence in the Rally Lenghts of Men and Women tennis games?
I got curious about the rally lenghts of men's and women's matches and to my naked eye it seemed as if the the womens rally lengths were longer. Here's what I found: a [blog post] (https://fourspacesplus.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/tennis-yeah-tennis/) -updated and an draft [Ipython notebook] (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ParseThis/rally-length-and-sex/blob/master/tennis.ipynb) for your data highness(es).
